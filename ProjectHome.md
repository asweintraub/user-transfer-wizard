user-transfer-wizard replicates the functionality of moveuser.exe using .NET on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  In addition to providing a command line interface, user-transfer-wizard also has a GUI to make one-off profile transfers easier.

This tool is handy for converting a local profile for use with a domain/network account and vice versa.
